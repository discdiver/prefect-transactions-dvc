# Use Prefect with DVC to version datasets and ML models

This repo accompanies an article that shows how to use Prefect 3's transaction capabilities to roll back task's side effects when model performance doesn't meet your specifications.

This example is adapted from DVC's Model Versioning tutorial. The original tutorial is available [here](https://dvc.org/doc/tutorials/versioning).
